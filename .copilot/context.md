# Copilot Context File for 2025Lesson2

## Purpose
This codebase is designed for high school students who are new to programming. The main goal is to help students learn Java and how to program robots using WPILib.

## Guidance for Copilot
- **Comment Style:**
  - All comments should be clear, simple, and easy for beginners to understand.
  - Avoid using advanced programming jargon or complex explanations.
  - Use examples and analogies where possible to help explain concepts.
- **Code Style:**
  - Use clear and descriptive variable and method names.
  - Break down complex logic into smaller, easy-to-understand steps.
  - Prefer readability over cleverness.
- **Documentation:**
  - Every class, method, and important block of code should have a comment explaining what it does and why it is used.
  - When introducing new WPILib features or Java concepts, add a short explanation in the comments.
- **Robot Programming:**
  - Explain how each part of the code relates to the robot's behavior.
  - When using WPILib classes or methods, briefly describe their purpose and how they help control the robot.
- **Encourage Experimentation:**
  - Encourage students to try changing values and running the code to see what happens.
  - Remind students that making mistakes is part of learning.

## Example Comment
```java
// This method drives the robot forward at half speed.
// We use the drive() method from WPILib to control the motors.
public void driveForward() {
    drive(0.5, 0.0); // 0.5 is the speed, 0.0 is the turn rate
}
```

## Additional Notes
- Assume students may be seeing Java and WPILib for the first time.
- Be patient and supportive in all explanations.
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are explained first.
